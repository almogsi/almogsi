### Hi there 👋

My name is Almog Simchon and I'm a postdoc at the School of Psychological Science at the University of Bristol. I'm doing social psychological research in domains of language, political psych, and emotion. Here you'll mainly find my attempts at developing R packages for computational text analysis. Some could actually be useful!
