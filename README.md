### Hi there 👋

I’m **Almog Simchon**, an Assistant Professor at **Ben-Gurion University of the Negev** and PI of the **Computational Social Psychology Lab**.

My research sits at the intersection of **social psychology, language, and political psychology**, with a focus on misinformation, polarization, emotion, and computational approaches to studying social behavior.  
On GitHub, you’ll mostly find my attempts to build **R packages and tools for computational text analysis**—some of which might even be useful.
