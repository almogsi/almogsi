### Hi there 👋

My name is Almog Simchon and I'm a PhD student at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev doing social psychological research in domains of language, political psych, and emotion. Here you'll mainly find my attempts at developing R packages for computational text analysis. Some could actually be useful!
